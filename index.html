    <ul>
        <li id="list-heading"><strong>Right Hardware<strong> </li>
            <li id="list-desc">At Swift, we always carefully check not only the relation between the purchase price and performance offered (CPU Performance per EUR), but we also look at the energy efficiency (CPU Performance per Watt) and durability of each hardware component. This way, we can be sure that purchased hardware will be long-lasting and inexpensive to operate, which translates directly into our ability to offer low prices.</li>
            <li id="list-heading"><strong>Scale & Standarization</strong></li>
            <li id="list-desc">Our prices are low because of the effects of scale. Of course, companies like AWS are bigger than us, but unlike most of our competitors, we have a fully unified hardware platform in all of our Data Centers around the world. Thanks to that, we not only get better discounts on purchase prices (which we then can pass on to our customers), but we also save money and time on maintenance.</li>
            <li id="list-heading"><strong>Optimisation</strong></li>
            <li id="list-desc">We use proprietary optimization scripts to manage load on our servers. This way, we are able to offer stable performance for all our customers at a great price point. Also, our logistics and warehouse management are optimized to reduce waste and thus give us space to offer even better prices.</li>
